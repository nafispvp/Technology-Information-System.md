### 📝Summary
Ts. Hj Abdul Alim explains about the importance of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). In working life, you'll only need about 40% programming skills and 60% SDLC. However, it is not as complicated as it sounds. SDLC only related to our daily life. For instance, we're making Nasi Lemak. We need planning which is what we want to cook. Next, we'll gather the resources which includes in designing process. Then, we'll have to cook which is the implentation part. Lastly, we'll test by tasting the Nasi Lemak.<br>

### 🪞Reflection
This talk opened my mind about how important it is to learn and remember all the subjects since it will be reused in working life. Most likely handling a project requires problem-solving skills.<br>
