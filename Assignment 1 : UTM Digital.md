Speaker : Pn. Aslinda binti Muhammad Aris <br>
She briefly explained about the services and facilities served by UTM Digital. UTM Digital serves a lot of crucial role for UTM including maintaining apps like UTMDigital, UTMPortal, UTMWifi and etc. There was also a QnA sessions so audience can ask what they need to know. <br>

- Create a more strategic stall management at a wider place for instance, outside UTMDigital because many stalls are hidden and not many audience notice some hidden stalls.
