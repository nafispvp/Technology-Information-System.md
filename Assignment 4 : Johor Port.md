### 📝Summary
The manager explains what websites they are using for managements. They use multiple apps so the projects they are handling are manageable and organised. They handle about 30 projects a year.<br>

### 🛠️Improvement Suggestions
- Show more on the applications used for clearer understanding.
- Give handouts about networks used since it was a complicated topic.<br>
