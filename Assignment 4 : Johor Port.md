### About
**Date** : 9 January 2026<br>
**Venue** : Johor Port, Pasir Gudang<br>

### Summary
The manager explains what websites they are using for managements. They use multiple apps so the projects they are handling are manageable and organised. They handle about 30 projects a year.<br>

---

### Improvement Suggestions
- Show more on the applications used for clearer understanding.
- Give handouts about networks used since it was a complicated topic.<br>

### Reflection
I get the vision to participate in a project. This program teaches me that system is important for making many projects easier to execute.<br>
