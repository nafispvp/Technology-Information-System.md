I worked on a design thinking project where we followed the main stages of the design thinking process: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. The project focused on identifying a real problem, understanding user needs, and proposing a solution through creative ideas. We collaborated as a team to brainstorm, design, and present our solution.<br>
